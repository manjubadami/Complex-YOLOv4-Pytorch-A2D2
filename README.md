# Complex-YOLOv4-Pytorch-A2D2

The PyTorch implementation based on the paper: [Complex-YOLO: Real-time 3D Object Detection on Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06199.pdf)
The modified version of Complex-YOLOv4-Pytorch, available at the GitHub repository [link](https://github.com/maudzung/Complex-YOLOv4-Pytorch), has been adapted specifically for the Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset (A2D2).
